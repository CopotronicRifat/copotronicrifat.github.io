<h1>S M Rafiuddin Rifat</h1>
    <h2>Department of Computer Science and Engineering</h2>
    <h2> Lecturer, University of Asia Pacific</h2>
<p>I'm working as a lecturer in Computer Science and Engineering department at University of Asia Pacific and I am a Machine Learning enthusiast. I love to share my knowledge with others and taught myself some of their stuff as well.

I mainly conduct the course entitles Pattern Recognition and the lab associated with that course.

My research interest includes Machine Learning, Pattern Recognition, Bioinformatics, and Computational Biology.

My primary goal is to build a strong mathematical background associated with my research interest.

Like most of the CS student, I am also a Python lover. C++ is also my second most favorite programming language.

I love MOOC learning a lot. I've recently completed Machine Learning and Algorithms: Design and Analysis course offered by Stanford University in Coursera and currently, I am enrolled in some other specializations e.g. Deep Learning, Photography, and Bioinformatics in Coursera. Trying to build a strong foundation in Sport-Programming and Logical Thinking.

I also love to write some short Science Fiction stories and articles on Mathematics related stuff in some online science portals. Sometimes I translate some stuff on my blog e.g. some interesting stuff like Turing Test, Science Fiction idea, Geometric Topology etc.

My undergrad education is over. I'm enrolled in the Master's program in Computer Science and Engineering department at Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology. I'm also seeking for a Graduate Research Assistant position in a Ph.D. program at a North American university. </p>
