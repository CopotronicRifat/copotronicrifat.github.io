			Prediction of secondary structure protein is an open problem that yet remains unsolved. The secondary structure of a protein is the structural combination of primary structure, which is the sequence of amino acids. If the amino acid sequence of an unknown protein matches with any other homologs, then the prediction is comparatively easy. But, if the primary structure i.e. sequence of amino acid does not match with any homologs, then the ab initio protein structure prediction comes in handy. But ab initio protein structure prediction is still in its development phase and works well on less than 120 residues of proteins. In this research, our goal is to use a slightly modified ab-initio model and to examine whether it is possible to improve the accuracy of secondary protein structure prediction by divide the fragments of primary protein structure and overlapping primary structure subpart and then predict the secondary protein by merging the predicted secondary structure from the segments of primary structure subpart.

			Phylogenetic tree is an important way in Bioinformatics to find the evolutionary relationship among the biological species. In this research, a proposed model is described for the estimation of a phylogenetic tree for a given set of data. To estimate a phylogenetic tree there are certain necessary steps have to consider. Gene sequences are useful data resources to estimate the relationship among species at the molecular level. In this research, the approach is to create a fusion between the existing models for the estimation of phylogenetic tree and a population-based meta-heuristics approach i.e. Genetic Algorithm. NCBI's Entrez databases are used for the acquisition of gene sequencing data. A modular parallel approach is applied to handle this dataset efficiently. This paper illustrates a proposed model to create an independent platform for phylogenetic tree estimation. Existing benchmark approaches for tree population that are used for population-based meta-heuristic search technique to find the best possible phylogenetic tree estimation for a given set of gene sequence data.
