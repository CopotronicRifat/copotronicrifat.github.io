<h1><b>S M Rafiuddin Rifat</b></h1>
    <h2>Department of Computer Science and Engineering</h2>
   
    <h2> Lecturer, University of Asia Pacific</h2>

<p style="font-family:Garamond">I'm working as a lecturer in Computer Science and Engineering department at University of Asia Pacific and I am a Machine Learning enthusiast. I love to share my knowledge with others and taught myself some of their stuff as well.
    
    </p>
<p style="font-family:Garamond">
I mainly conduct the course entitles Pattern Recognition and the lab associated with that course.
</p><p style="font-family:Garamond">
My research interest includes Machine Learning, Pattern Recognition, Bioinformatics, and Computational Biology.
<p style="font-family:Garamond">
My primary goal is to build a strong mathematical background associated with my research interest.
</p> <p style="font-family:Garamond">
Like most of the CS student, I am also a Python lover. C++ is also my second most favorite programming language.
</p><p style="font-family:Garamond">
I love MOOC learning a lot. I've recently completed Machine Learning and Algorithms: Design and Analysis course offered by Stanford University in Coursera and currently, I am enrolled in some other specializations e.g. Deep Learning, Photography, and Bioinformatics in Coursera. Trying to build a strong foundation in Sport-Programming and Logical Thinking.
</p><p style="font-family:Garamond">
I also love to write some short Science Fiction stories and articles on Mathematics related stuff in some online science portals. Sometimes I translate some stuff on my blog e.g. some interesting stuff like Turing Test, Science Fiction idea, Geometric Topology etc.
</p><p style="font-family:Garamond">
My undergrad education is over. I'm enrolled in the Master's program in Computer Science and Engineering department at Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology. I'm also seeking for a Graduate Research Assistant position in a Ph.D. program at a North American university. </p>
